I successfully defended my thesis titled: Graph Characteristics and Branch-and-Reduce Algorithms for Minimum Vertex Cover.
My thesis is availble [through this link](http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/resolver/1840.20/35501) (you are also welcome to contact me directly for a copy)

I am going to take a break from school and work.

I will likely put up a "reader's" guide to my thesis later.
